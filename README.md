# Crime-Analysis-using-EDA
This project is done by exploratory data analysis using Python.
This project is developed in Jupyter editor.
Various libraries of python are used.
We found the results by visualizing the dataset.

                                                           Introduction
Crime analysis and prevention is a systematic approach for identifying and analyzing patterns and trends in crime.
Our system can provide insights of the type of crime activity which have high probability for given location in terms of latitude and longitude and date and also, we can visualize crime prone areas. 
Here we have an approach between computer science and criminal justice to develop a data mining procedure that can help solve crimes faster. 
Instead of focusing on causes of crime occurrence.
This project aims to provide insights into crime patterns in Boston and to aid in crime prevention and law enforcement efforts.
The dataset contains information on the type and location of crimes, as well as the date and time they occurred.
The analysis includes visualizations of crime trends over time, such as the number of crimes per year, month, day of the week, and hour of the day.
Additionally, the analysis explores the distribution of crimes across Boston's districts and streets, as well as the types of crimes that are most common. 
It is a data analysis or visualization project involving crime data. 
The code loads a CSV file of crime data, performs some data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generates various visualizations using different Python libraries.
